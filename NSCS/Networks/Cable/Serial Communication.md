 Almost all network communications occur using a serial communication delivery. Serial communication transmits bits sequentially over a single channel.

In contrast, parallel communications simultaneously transmit several bits using multiple wires.

As the cable length increases, the synchronization timing between multiple channels becomes more sensitive to distance. For this reason, parallel communication is limited to very short distances
