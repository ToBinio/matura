Modern WANS have more connectivity options than [[Legacy WAN|traditional WANs]].
- Enterprises now require faster and more flexible WAN connectivity options.
- Traditional WAN connectivity options have rapidly declined in use because they are either no longer available, too expensive, or have limited bandwidth.

New technologies are continually emerging. The figure summarizes the modern WAN connectivity options.

**Dedicated broadband**
- Fiber can be installed independently by an organization to connect remote locations directly together.
- Dark fiber can be leased or purchased from a supplier.
[[WAN#Packet Switching]]    
- Metro Ethernet – Replacing many traditional WAN options.
- MPLS – Enables sites to connect to the provider regardless of its access technologies.
**Internet-based broadband**    
- Organizations are now commonly using the global internet infrastructure for WAN connectivity.

### Ethernet WAN
Service providers now offer Ethernet WAN service using [[Fiber Optic|fiber-optic]] cabling.
The Ethernet WAN service can go by many names, including the following:
- **Metropolitan Ethernet (Metro E)**
- **Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS)**
- **Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS)**

There are several benefits to an Ethernet WAN:
- **Reduced expenses and administration**
- **Easy integration with existing networks**
- **Enhanced business productivity**

### Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)

MPLS is a high-performance service provider WAN routing technology to interconnect clients without regard to access method or payload.
- MPLS supports a variety of client access methods (e.g., Ethernet, DSL, Cable, Frame Relay).
- MPLS can encapsulate all types of protocols including [[IP-v4|IPv4]] and [[IP-v6|IPv6]] traffic.
- An MPLS router can be a customer edge (CE) router, a provider edge (PE) router, or an internal provider (P) router.
- MPLS routers are label switched routers (LSRs). They attach labels to packets that are then used by other MPLS routers to forward traffic.
- MPLS also provides services for QoS support, traffic engineering, redundancy, and VPNs.
