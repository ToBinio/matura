 Influence on Storage Choice
o SSD and in-memory storage are more expensive but provide higher performance (low latency,
fast access). These are ideal for mission-critical applications where performance outweighs
cost.
o HDD storage, on the other hand, is cheaper per gigabyte and is often used for bulk storage of
large data sets that don't require frequent or fast access.
