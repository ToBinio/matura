Definition: The volume of data to be stored can range from a few gigabytes to multiple petabytes, and it
significantly impacts the storage choice.
 Influence on Storage Choice
o For small data sets, high-speed storage like SSD is often preferred, especially if performance is
a concern. Backup and replication for such small data sets are also relatively simple.
o For medium data sets, a mix of SSD for frequently accessed data and HDD for less accessed
data is often a cost-effective and performance-optimal solution.
In short, the balance between access time, cost, maintenance effort, and data size determine the most
appropriate data storage solution for any organization.
