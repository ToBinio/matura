ï‚· Influence on Storage Choice
o On-premise storage requires significant maintenance, including managing hardware, security,
backups, updates, and scaling. The more complex the system, the higher the maintenance
effort.
o Cloud-based storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage) significantly reduce
maintenance overhead, as the cloud provider handles security, redundancy, and backups.
o Distributed storage systems may require specialized skills and tools to maintain due to their
complexity but can provide massive scalability and fault tolerance.
o Automated tiering and scaling in modern cloud storage solutions can reduce the maintenance
effort by moving data between different tiers based on usage automatically.
